# Project 2: Using ML to Predict Movie Success

Data from The Movie Databse was used to create regression and classification models to predict movie success in 3 different ways:
- predict movie revenue
- predict movie return-on-investment (ROI)
- predict movie success (hit, flop, break-even)

This project is an end-to-end project that involves additional data files (lists of top actors and directors) that can be found in the data folder.

Some topics covered in this project are:
- Data Cleaning and Wrangling
- EDA and Statistical Hypothesis Testing
- Building Regression and Classification Models (kNN, SVM, Linear and Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting)
- Outlier Analysis and Feature Engineering
- Enhancing Model Interpretability using Shapley Values

A report and slide deck summarizing the process and findings can be found in the respective folders. Please feel free to reach out with any additional questions at deeptitilly@gmail.com
