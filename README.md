# Data Science Project Portfolio by Deepti Srivastava Tilly

Welcome to my Data Science Project Portfolio! This repository currently includes 2 end-to-end machine learning projects.

**Project 1: Sentiment Analysis and Topic Modeling of Political Twitter Data**
- Uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools to predict the Twitter sentiment around three 2020 presidential candidates (Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden)
- Develops a sentiment classifier using lexicon-based methods and machine learning to classify tweets as positive, neutral, or negative
- Cleaning and wrangling of unstructured text data from Twitter
- Models used for classification: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Deep Learning (LSTM)
- Topic modeling of tweets using unsupervised learning (NMF and LDA)

**Project 2: Using Machine Learning to Predict Movie Success**
- Uses regression and classification to predict movie success in 3 different ways (Revenue, ROI, Outcome: Hit-Flop-Breakeven)
- Models used: Linear and Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Trees, SVM, Gradient Boosting, kNN
- Data cleaning, wrangling, EDA of messy structured numerical data
- Incorporates feature engineering, outlier analysis using Cook's Distance, and enhanced model interpretatability using Shapley values
