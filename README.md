# Data Science Project Portfolio by Deepti Srivastava Tilly

Welcome to my Data Science Project Portfolio! This repository currently includes 2 end-to-end machine learning projects.

**Project 1: Sentiment Analysis and Topic Modeling of Political Twitter Data**
- Uses natural language processing (NLP) tools to predict the Twitter sentiment around three 2020 presidential candidates (Sanders, Warren, Biden)
- Develops a sentiment classifier using lexicon-based methods and machine learning to classify tweets as positive, neutral, or negative
- Cleaning and wrangling of unstructured text data
- Models used for classification: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Deep Learning (LSTM)
- Topic modeling of tweets using unsupervised learning (NMF and LDA)

**Project 2: Using Machine Learning to Predict Movie Success**
- Uses regression and classification to predict movie success in 3 different ways (revenue, ROI, hit-flop-breakeven)
- Models used are Linear and Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Trees, SVM, Gradient Boosting
- Data cleaning, wrangling, EDA of structured numerical data
- Incorporates feature engineering, outlier analysis using Cook's Distance, and enhanced model interpretatability using Shapley values
